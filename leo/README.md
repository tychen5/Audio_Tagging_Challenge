## Doing ##
- Integration、opening
- feature extracting
- Bagging

## Feature Extracting ##
- Using MFCC extract spectrogram of 40*
- Using FBank extract spectrogram of 128*1034

## Bagging ##
To lower variance error
- In phase 1 split to 30% * 3 for training and validate, 10% for testing
- In phase 2 

## Boosting ##
To lower bias error
- In phase 1 ensemble voting for stage 2

## Stacking ##
- In phase 1 use the prediction of phase 1's testing output to tune stage 2
- In phase 2
